INFO:root:Question: Why do patients with kidney disease get swelling in their legs?
INFO:root:Answer: Swelling in the legs is a common complication of kidney disease. When the kidneys are not functioning properly, they are unable to remove excess fluid from the body. This can lead to fluid accumulation in the body's tissues, including the legs. Additionally, kidney disease can cause changes in the body's hormonal balance, which can also contribute to leg swelling. It is important for patients with kidney disease to monitor their fluid levels and work closely with their healthcare providers to

INFO:root:Answer: Based on the context provided, it is difficult to determine if SGLT2 inhibitors are safe in 2025. The context discusses the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, and how these drugs may reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, it does not address the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in the general population or in individuals without a history of diabetes or kidney disease. Therefore, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional to determine the safety and appropriate use of SGLT2 inhibitors for an individual's specific medical condition and circumstances.

INFO:root:Answer: The swelling in your legs could be caused by several factors, including acute periarthritis, acute interstitial nephritis, or renal vein thrombosis (RVT).

    Acute periarthritis is a condition where calcium phosphate crystals deposit in the joint, resulting in pain and inflammation. This can be especially common in patients with hyperphosphatemia, or high levels of calcium in the blood.

    Acute interstitial nephritis is another potential cause of leg swelling, and it occurs when there is damage to the tubules in the kidneys. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including medications, infections, or other systemic illnesses.

    RVT is a blood clot that forms in the renal vein, and it can cause sudden onset of symptoms such as loin pain, scrotal swelling, fever

INFO:root:Answer: 117


The clinical manifestations of extracellular fluid volume expansion depend on the underlying cause. In left heart failure (HF), patients may experience exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. In contrast, patients with right-sided HF or biventricular failure may exhibit weight gain and lower limb swelling. Physical examination may reveal increased swelling in any of these cases.

In the context of hyponatremia, the brain may also develop swelling due to increased intracranial pressure caused by cellular edema within the brain. This can lead to a neurologic syndrome. However, in most hyponatremic patients, mechanisms of volume regulation prevent cerebral edema, and a decrease in cerebral extracellular volume occurs by movement of fluid into the body within 1 to 3 hours after hyponatremia develops.

INFO:root:Question: what is GFR
INFO:root:Answer: GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It is a measure of how much waste products and excess fluids are removed from the blood by the kidneys through a process called glomerular filtration. The normal range for GFR is approximately 130 mL/min/1.73 m2 for men and 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 for women, but this can vary based on factors such as age, sex, body size, physical activity, diet, blood pressure, glycemia, and pharmacotherapy.

INFO:root:Answer: Swelling: Causes, Symptoms, and Diagnosis What is swelling? Internal swelling is often a side effect of a medication or the result of a serious injury. What causes swelling? Although fluid retention is an internal condition, it may also cause external swelling. An imaging test, such as an ultrasound, can offer more information about the cause of the swelling. Your doctor might also prescribe medication to relieve inflammation or swelling. If a chronic illness is causing external or internal swelling, you may be able to prevent further swelling by properly managing your illness or by taking medications to treat it. Medication is also used when you have internal swelling as a result of inflammation.

INFO:root:Question: i have swelling in my legs
INFO:root:Answer: You may be experiencing leg swelling. This condition can affect anyone, but its most frequent during pregnancy and in people over 65. Most Common Causes of Leg Swelling Your legs swell for a few main reasons, including: Fluid buildup (edema) Sometimes, blood and other fluids can pool in the legs, causing swelling. This might happen when you have problems with your heart, blood vessels, lymphatic system, or kidneys. One of the first symptoms of DVT or thrombophlebitis is a swollen leg (especially the calf), as blood pools in the area.

INFO:root:Question: what is gfr?
INFO:root:Answer: GFR stands for glomerular filtration rate, which is a measure of how well the kidneys are able to filter waste products from the blood and excrete them in the urine. GFR is calculated by multiplying the average filtration rate of each nephron in the kidneys by the number of nephrons in both kidneys. The normal range for GFR is approximately 130 mL/min/1.73 m2 for men and 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 for women, but this can vary depending on factors such as age, sex, body size, physical activity, diet, blood pressure, and glycemia. If a person's GFR is below the normal range, it may indicate kidney disease or other health problems.

Check with your doctor right away if you have swelling in one leg or any of these symptoms: Instead of filtering water and waste material from your blood, fluid gathers in your body, which causes swelling in your arms and legs. If you have swollen legs and shortness of breath during the last trimester or soon after delivery, talk to your doctor about a condition called peripartum cardiomyopathy  a type of heart failure related to pregnancy.
